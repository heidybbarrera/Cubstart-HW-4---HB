                <h3>Education Equality and Income project</h3>
                <p>The objective of this project is to learn how to analyze multiple datasets while also learning essential techniques used in data science. We want to educate students on how to provide precise and organized data. We will use datasets that describe different metrics of education quality, including standardized test scores, attendance, suspension/expulsion rate, and college readiness. In addition, we will also use the US census dataset for information on median household income. Through these datasets, we will analyze if there is any correlation between school quality and income rate across different counties of California. We will also be able to specifically look at various factors that contribute to that data. Our main goal is to have students prepare a final deliverable that summarizes their findings and/or conclusions they may have found over the course of the semester. This project will cover data science skills such as data cleaning, creating visualizations, and analyzing trends. </p>
